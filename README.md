# Email_classifier

This project implements an end-to-end email classification system for a company's support team. The system classifies incoming support emails into predefined categories (Incident, Request, Change, Problem) while ensuring personally identifiable information (PII) is securely masked before processing. It uses NER techniques (without LLMs) such as regex and spaCy for masking sensitive fields like names, emails, phone numbers, and credit card information. The masked email is then passed to a text classification model, and the original entities are restored in the output. The solution is deployed as a FastAPI backend API on Hugging Face Spaces and adheres to strict input-output formatting requirements. The /classify POST endpoint accepts an email and returns the classification, masked text, and original PII entities in JSON format.
